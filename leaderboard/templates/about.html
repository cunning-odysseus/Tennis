<h1> <b> Game rules </b> </h1>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1. GAMES ARE PLAYED TO 11 POINTS</strong><br>
        A Game is played to 11 points. A Game must be won by two points.
    </li>
    <li><strong>2. ALTERNATE SERVES EVERY TWO POINTS</strong><br>
        Each side of the table alternates serving two points at a time. <strong>EXCEPTION:</strong> After tied 10-10 (“deuce”), service alternates at every point. Can you lose on a serve in ping pong? Yes! There is no separate rule for serving on Game Point.
    </li>
    <li><strong>3. TOSS THE BALL STRAIGHT UP WHEN SERVING</strong><br>
        How do you serve the ball in ping pong? Hold the ball in your open palm, behind your end of the table. Toss at least 6” straight up, and strike it on the way down. It must hit your side of the table and then the other side. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Once the ball leaves the server’s hand it is in play, and so counts as the receiver’s point if the ball is missed or mis-hit.
    </li>
    <li><strong>4. THE SERVE CAN LAND ANYWHERE IN SINGLES</strong><br>
        There is no restriction on where the ball lands on your side or your opponent’s side of the table. It can bounce two or more times on your opponent’s side (if so, that’s your point), bounce over the side, or even hit the edge.
    </li>
</ul>

<h1> <b> How do the ratings work? </b> </h1>
<p> This webapp uses Arpad Elo's rating system. The Elo rating system is a way to calculate the relative skill levels of players, primarily used in chess but also in other competitive games.
    Below you can find an explanation, however there is also a nice video by James Grime explaining the system:

<h1>Elo Rating System Explanation</h1>
    
<h2>Starting Point</h2>
<p>Each player starts with a certain number of points (here the starting point is 400).</p>

<h2>Expected Outcome</h2>
<p>Before each game, the system estimates each player's chances of winning based on their current ratings. If two players have similar ratings, each has about a 50% chance of winning. But if one player has a much higher rating, the system expects them to win and gives them a higher win probability.</p>

<h2>Point Exchange</h2>
<p>After the game, points are exchanged between the players:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a higher-rated player wins, they gain only a few points because it was expected.</li>
    <li>If a lower-rated player wins, they gain more points because it was unexpected.</li>
    <li>If the game is a draw, the lower-rated player still gains a few points, while the higher-rated player loses some.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adjustments Over Time</h2>
<p>As players play more games and either win or lose, their ratings adjust to better reflect their skill levels. The more games a player has, the more stable their rating becomes.</p>
